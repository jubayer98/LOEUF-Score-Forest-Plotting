# Forest Plotting for LOEUF Score

This repository contains data related to gene analysis, specifically focusing on "loss of function" (LoF) variants within genes. The key terms "oe_lof", "oe_lof_lower", and "oe_lof_upper" are explained below to help understand their significance in genetic studies.

## Key Terms

- **Gene**: Represents the specific gene being analyzed.

- **oe_lof (Observed/Expected Ratio of Loss-of-Function)**: 
  - A statistical measure used to determine the frequency of loss-of-function mutations in a gene compared to the expected frequency under a neutral model.
  - **Values Interpretation**:
    - Close to 1: LoF mutations occur as expected by chance.
    - Significantly lower than 1: Indicates purifying selection against LoF mutations.
    - Higher than 1: Suggests LoF mutations are tolerated or under positive selection.

- **oe_lof_lower**: The lower bound of the confidence interval for the oe_lof ratio, indicating the potential variation in the observed/expected ratio due to sampling error or other factors.

- **oe_lof_upper**: The upper bound of the confidence interval for the oe_lof ratio, representing the potential maximum oe_lof ratio that could occur given the data.

## Example

For a gene called ABC1:
- **oe_lof**: 0.5
- **oe_lof_lower**: 0.3
- **oe_lof_upper**: 0.7

In this example, the observed/expected ratio of loss-of-function for gene ABC1 is 0.5, suggesting that LoF mutations in ABC1 are selected against by evolutionary processes. The confidence interval ranges from 0.3 to 0.7, indicating statistical uncertainty but consistently showing selection against loss of function.
